# Mental Health Monitoring App

## Description

The Mental Health Monitoring App is a compassionate technological solution designed to support individuals in tracking and understanding their emotional well-being through the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP). By analyzing journal entries or text inputs, the app identifies mood patterns, sentiment, and emotional states, offering users insights into their mental health over time. The project leverages cutting-edge NLP techniques and libraries such as spaCy, TextBlob, and NRCLex to process and analyze text, making mental health monitoring accessible and insightful.

## Features

- **Secure Text Entry**: Users can safely record their daily thoughts, feelings, and experiences in a secure and private manner.
- **NLP Analysis**: Implements advanced NLP techniques to evaluate the mood, sentiment, and emotions conveyed in the text entries, identifying patterns that may indicate distress or shifts in mental well-being.
- **Mood and Sentiment Insights**: Provides feedback and visualizations of the user's emotional trends over time, helping them understand their mental health patterns.
- **Emotion Detection**: Utilizes NRCLex to identify and report the primary emotions present in text entries, offering a deeper understanding of the user's emotional state.
- **Privacy-Centric Design**: Ensures the utmost confidentiality and security of user data, respecting their privacy and trust.

## How It Works

1. **Text Input**: Users write or record their daily logs within the app.
2. **NLP Processing**: The app analyzes the text using spaCy for linguistic features, TextBlob for sentiment analysis, and NRCLex for emotion detection.
3. **Insights Generation**: Based on the analysis, the app provides feedback on mood trends, sentiment scores, and detected emotions.
4. **User Feedback**: Users receive insights into their mental health, empowering them to understand and manage their emotional well-being better.
